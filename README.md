# Spark-iOS
## Introduction
Spark is the [Adevinta](https://www.adevinta.com/) â€™s iOS Design System.
Its mission is to provide an easy to use, customizable UI experience for consumers.

### Theming & Components
To achieve that, we based our core experience around having Themes containing values like Colors or Fonts that will be used by our Components.

## Getting Started
### Installation 
Carthage: `github "adevinta/spark-ios" == 0.3.1`

#### Plug & Play 
If you want the easy to use Spark, we provide a Plug & Play solution containing a single Theme ready to be used. For that, import Spark.xcframework
